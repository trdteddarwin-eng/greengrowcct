    objection: "We already have an agency",
    responseA:
      "Totally respect that — most of the companies we work with came to us while they were already with another agency. I'm not asking you to switch. What I am curious about: are they running geo-fenced retargeting campaigns for you? Specifically, are they targeting people who visited your competitors' websites or physical locations? Most agencies miss that entirely, and it's usually a 30-40% lift in qualified leads. What if I put together a free side-by-side audit — your current campaigns next to what we'd run — and you just see the gaps? No pressure, no commitment. If your current agency is crushing it, I'll be the first to tell you to stay. Fair enough?",
    responseB:
      "That's great — honestly, it tells me you already understand the value of marketing, which means this conversation is way easier. Quick question though: when's the last time your agency brought you a new strategy you hadn't seen before? The reason I ask is that the space is changing fast — first-party data strategies, AI-powered lead nurture, server-side tracking — and a lot of agencies are still running the same playbook from 2021. I'm not here to trash your agency. But I've found that about 70% of the businesses I talk to have at least one major gap their current provider isn't addressing. Would it be worth 15 minutes to see if there's a blind spot? Worst case, you confirm your agency is doing everything right and you feel great about it.",

    id: "handle-in-house",
    objection: "We handle ads in-house",
    responseA:
      "That's awesome — it means someone on your team already gets digital, which is rare. I'm curious though: who's actually managing the campaigns day-to-day? Because what I hear from most in-house teams is that the person running ads is also doing 5 other things — social media, email, website updates — and the ads end up getting checked maybe once a week. And when CPMs spike or a campaign suddenly underperforms, it sits for days before anyone catches it. We work alongside in-house teams all the time. We don't replace you — we become your performance arm. You keep control of the brand and creative, we handle the bid optimization, audience testing, and daily management that eats up 15-20 hours a week. Would it be worth a quick call to see where the bottlenecks are?",
    responseB:
      "Smart — keeping it in-house gives you a lot of control. Let me ask you something though: are you running A/B tests on your landing pages and creative at least weekly? And are you adjusting audience segments based on conversion data, not just click data? Because that's usually the gap I see with in-house teams — the ads might be decent, but the optimization loop is slow. We had a client doing their own ads — spending $8K/month, getting a 2.5x ROAS. Same budget, we got them to 4.8x in 60 days just by tightening the optimization cycles and rebuilding their audiences around purchase intent. What if we did a free performance audit — I'll show you exactly where the leakage is in your current setup? Takes 15 minutes and you keep everything you learn even if you never talk to us again.",

  {
    id: "tried-ads-didnt-work",
    objection: "We tried ads and they didn't work",
    responseA:
      "I hear that a lot, and honestly? Most of the time, the ads didn't fail — the strategy did. Let me ask: when you ran ads before, were you sending traffic to a dedicated landing page with a single call-to-action, or to your main website? And were you tracking actual booked appointments or jobs, not just clicks and form fills? Because here's what usually happens: a business runs ads, sends traffic to their homepage, gets a bunch of clicks, but the leads don't convert because there's no clear path from ad to action. Then they say 'ads don't work.' The ads were fine — the funnel was broken. We build the entire system: the ad, the landing page, the follow-up automation, and we track all the way to revenue — not just leads. Would you be open to a 15-minute call where I audit what went wrong last time? If I can't identify a specific fixable problem, I'll tell you straight up that ads might not be the right channel for you.",
    responseB:
      "I appreciate you being straight with me — and I'm not going to pretend that every ad campaign works, because they don't. But can I ask what happened? Who was running them, and what did the setup look like? The reason I ask is that 8 out of 10 times when someone tells me ads didn't work, it's one of three things: wrong audience targeting, no follow-up system for the leads, or they were measuring the wrong metrics. For example, we took on a roofing company last year that had 'failed' with Google Ads. When I looked at their old account, they were targeting a 50-mile radius with broad match keywords — they were paying $40 per click for people searching 'DIY roof repair.' We rebuilt it with exact-match keywords in a 15-mile radius, added a dedicated landing page, and they went from zero to 35 exclusive leads per month at $28 each. If I could show you specifically what went wrong and what we'd do differently, would you give me 15 minutes?",

    id: "too-expensive",
    objection: "Too expensive",
    responseA:
      "I totally get it — and I'd never ask you to spend money that doesn't come back with a return. But let me reframe the question: it's not about what it costs, it's about what it produces. If I told you that for every $1 you put in, you'd get $4-$6 back in revenue within 90 days — would that be too expensive? Because that's exactly what we're targeting. Our average client sees a 4-6x return on ad spend within the first quarter. And here's the thing — we don't lock you into a 12-month contract. We do month-to-month because if we're not producing results, you should fire us. So the risk isn't really on you. What if we started with a smaller test budget — say $1,500 total for 30 days — and I prove the ROI before you commit to anything larger? If it doesn't work, you're out $1,500 and you never have to talk to me again. If it does, you'll wish you started sooner. Fair?",
    responseB:
      "Completely understand — every dollar matters, especially right now. Can I ask what you're comparing it to, though? Because expensive is relative. If your average customer is worth $3,000 in lifetime value and I can get you customers at $150 each, that's a 20x return. Is that expensive? What most business owners find is that NOT marketing is actually more expensive — it's just an invisible cost. Every month you're not running targeted campaigns, your competitors are picking up the customers that would have come to you. We had a client who said the same thing — 'too expensive.' They were spending $0 on digital. Their competitor down the street was spending $3,000/month and had stolen 30% of their market share in 18 months. They finally came to us, and within 6 months they'd recaptured most of that lost share. What if I showed you a concrete projection — here's what the investment looks like, here's the expected return, and here's the timeline? No pressure — just math. Would 15 minutes be worth it?",

    id: "send-me-email",
    objection: "Send me an email",
    responseA:
      "Happy to do that — I'll send something over today. But I'll be honest with you: I send about 50 emails a week and I know most of them end up buried. And this probably isn't the kind of thing that translates well in an email anyway. Let me ask you one quick question before I let you go — it'll take 10 seconds: Are you currently running any paid advertising to bring in new customers, or is most of your business coming from referrals and word of mouth? I ask because the strategy would be completely different depending on your answer, and I want to make sure what I send you is actually relevant and not just generic marketing fluff. Sound fair?",
    responseB:
      "Absolutely — what's the best email? [Take the email.] Perfect, I'll send that over. Now, just so I send you the right information and not a generic brochure that'll go straight to trash — what's your biggest growth challenge right now? Is it getting more leads, converting the leads you have, or something else? I want to tailor what I send so it's actually worth the 2 minutes it takes to read. And honestly, if it turns out we're not a fit, I'd rather figure that out now and save us both the time. What would you say is the number one thing holding your business back from growing faster right now?",

  {
    id: "not-interested",
    objection: "Not interested",
    responseA:
      "Totally fair — and I appreciate you being direct. Most people are 'not interested' in a sales call, and I get it. But let me ask you something completely unrelated to what I'm selling: if I could show you exactly how your top local competitor is getting their customers online — what keywords they're bidding on, what ads they're running, and roughly what they're spending — would that be useful to you? Even if you never work with us, that competitive intel is valuable. I can put together a free competitor analysis and send it over. No strings attached, no follow-up call required. It takes us about 10 minutes and it's genuinely useful stuff. Would that be worth taking a look at?",
    responseB:
      "I hear you — and the last thing I want to do is waste your time. Can I just ask one quick question before I go? What's your current strategy for getting new customers? I ask because if business is booming and you're turning people away, then you're absolutely right — you don't need me. But if there are months where things slow down and you wish the phone would ring more, that's exactly the problem we solve. We work with [their industry] businesses specifically, and our average client adds $15,000-$30,000 in monthly revenue within the first 90 days. If that's not something you need, no worries at all — I'll let you go. But if there's even a chance that's relevant, would 15 minutes be worth exploring?",
